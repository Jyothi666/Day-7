      the second half."[41] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated

      of grey.[44] Sify wrote that "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy
      caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with
      negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from
      the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional
      scenes."[45] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances,

      a good dancer and does justice to his role."[55] Another critic wrote that
      "Allu Arjun is excellent as the groom who goes all out to get his bride
      back. His mass dialogues are good in the second half."[56] He achieved his
      second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the performance in the
      film.
